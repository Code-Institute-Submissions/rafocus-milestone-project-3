# Milestone Project 3
## Online Cookbook
Design and implement a website where users can share cooking recipes and view a list of recipes available.

## UX

### User stories:

A user can use the website in the following scenarios:

- Create an account with a username.
- Create a new recipe, add information like ingredients, directions, a picture.
- Edit or delete an exiting recipe already created by the user.
- View the list of recipes available on the website including the ones shared by other users.
